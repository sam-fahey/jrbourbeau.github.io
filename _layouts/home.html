<h1>About me</h1>
<section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
    <p>
        I'm a research assistant and physics Ph.D. candidate at University of Wisconsin - Madison. 
        As a member of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory Collaboration, 
        I conduct analyses searching for correlation of neutrino data with transient astrophysical objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        My work consists of writing software and building statistical models to test physics hypotheses. 
        I'm interested in machine learning techniques both for applications in my research and as a hobby,
        and I enjoy playing music, cooking, and painting.
